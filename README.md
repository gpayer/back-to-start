### Overview

This extensions implements a "go back to the start of the current website"-button as it was available in Opera.

This means if you enter some website http://www.xyz.com and then browse some photo slideshow 50 pages deep you can go back to the start of http://www.xyz.com with a single click.
Only the actual browser history is used, so you won't end up on a 404 page like it happens with "navigate up" extension.

After activation a new button with a double arrow appears in your toolbar, just move it to where you like it best. This might not the best way to handle it, but it's easy to program and it works.

There are no usability configuration options at the moment, as I simply have no idea what else to add.

### Future features

* Mobile support
* Automatic placement of "back-to-start" button
* Choose own button image
